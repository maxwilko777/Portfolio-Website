# Portfolio-Website
First website to demonstrate my understanding and background.

THIS WEBSITE IS MY FIRST BUSINESS LEVEL PROJECT

While i am studying Computer Science as a student i will be adding and updating this website regularly. 
The main purpose for this website is for employers to see what i can offer as a programmer while learning about me and my background.
In the future i want to work as a Software Engineer, i love the idea of working on software which can effect people's daily life.
